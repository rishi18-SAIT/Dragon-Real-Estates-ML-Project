🧠 Key Features
✅ Load and explore structured real estate data

✅ Handle missing values and outliers

✅ Create insightful data visualizations (price vs. size, location, etc.)

✅ Feature engineering (e.g., converting area units, encoding locations)

✅ Train a regression model to predict house prices

✅ Save the trained model for deployment

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

scikit-learn

📊 Sample Visuals
Price distribution

Actual vs. Predicted prices

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Install the required libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Launch the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook dragon_real_estates.ipynb
Run the cells step-by-step to explore and build the model.

📌 Future Improvements
Incorporate location-based features using geolocation APIs

Deploy the model as a Flask web app

Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
